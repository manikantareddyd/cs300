<h1>The Mating Mind</h1>

<h2>Geoffrey Miller</h2>

<h4>A review by Manikanta Reddy</h4>
<p>Some see Darwinian evolution as being very cold and ruthless struggle for survival, but the question remains and we wonder how and why we are capable display creativity, art, playfulness, etc. To deal with this precise questionn in general Miller invokes sexual selection to fill the holes in human nature left unexplained by natural selection. In scientific terms, sexual selection through mate choice seemed a neglected factor in human mental evolution.<p> 
<p>
But now it is clear that sexual selection theory offers us valuable intelligence about aspects of human nature that are important to us, and that cry out for evolutionary explanation, but that have been ignored, dismissed, or belittled in the past. Then Miller proceeds to explain how natural and sexual selection are different, in the mannner that gene pool is chosen for a new generation. He argues that we were neither created by an ominiscient deity, nor did we evolve by blind, dumb natural selection. 
<p>He quotes a very nice example of peacock tails. Peacok tail is a redundant feature that hinders the birds ability to fly. And these brightly displayed colors are also a good callouts for predators, but peahens seem to choose these evolutionary unfit peococks over others just based on the fact that they are alive even with those redundant features.
<p>One way of looking at this is that the claim that women have selectively breeding mwn for all the past we know. Although I felt that this analysis was on the speculative side, with hardly any acceptable evidence to back it up. If you ever wondered why guys go goofy over girls, while all girls do is to giggle and whisper all you need to do is to read Mating Mind. Miller explains it, and he does it in an entertaining(and a sexy) way. 
<p>The first half of the book spends a lot of time detailing the general forces of sexual selection and the adaptations favored by it, giving examples drawn from other organisms. Only after a fairly exhaustive 175 pages do we get to the finer details of human adaptations from sexual selection. It's well worth it for anyone with an interest in evolutionary psychology.
