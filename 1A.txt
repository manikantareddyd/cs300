The Astronomy Club is part of the Science and Technology Council, IIT Kanpur. Here, we attempt to bring about an interest and awareness in the field of Astronomy and Space Research.

All along the we have been promoting amateur astronomy through talks, competitions and shows. Astronomy is fun, but it can be even more fun when you do it with other people. So here we are for you to be amazed along with you.

==History==
The Astronomy Club is one of the oldest clubs of the institute. It was formed in the 1975 by a group of young enthusiasts who had a thing for cosmos. Since then Astronomy club has come far and now aims at keeping the fire alive

==Structure==

'''Coordinators''': The club is headed by 2-4 Coordinators, usually Junior Undergraduate students. The coordinators serve a tenure of 1 year and are responsible for the conduction of all the activities as well as managing the finances. 

'''Secretaries''': 10-12 Secretaries work with the Coordinators to ensure smooth conduction of all the activities. They are responsible for the publicity of the events. Usually the secretaries are Undergraduate Sophomores.

==Astronomy Observation Sessions==

We hold Observation sessions regularly. In these sessions, telescope will be used for observing Moon, nebulae, planets like Saturn etc. However, naked eye observations and using binoculars also plays an important role in astronomy. Informal session involving small quizzes and general discussions.

==Planetarium Shows==

We are proud to have our own in-house planetarium built entirely by students. The planetarium was inaugurated on Jan 29th, 2012, and still stands to marvel the dedication of the students who built it. Today we host various planetarium shows, some of which are made by the students themselves.

==Astrophotography==

To the uninitiated, nothing could be more logical than a focal photography: if you look through a telescope's eyepiece, why wouldn't you point a camera into it? The club has its own SLR camera which is used for various photo-metrical projects.
